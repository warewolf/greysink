REMEMBER: EVERYTHING IS ASYNC PASSING STATE.

Query comes in
 - we need to be able to do queries in "parallel" - whitelist, sinkhole, recursive
 - make a chain of events where one can terminate the chain early
   - post to whitelist w/ response callback
   - if whitelist fails, post to sinkhole w/ response callback
     - if sinkhole fails, post to recursive w/ response callback
